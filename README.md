# Vehicle Builder

## Description
This vehicle builder was created to give users the ability to either create a vehicle from scratch by adding the details themselves or select a prebuilt vehicle.  They can then use this program to have their vehicles perform a series of actions, some specific to the type of vehicle they are using.

## Installation
Prior to usage of this program it will be neccesary to have inquirer installed.  You can do this in the terminal by typing 'npm i inquirer'.

## Usage
To use, first type npm start. You will be prompted to either create a new vehicle or select from a list of prebuilt ones. When creating a new one, you will be prompted to fill out several details about your vehicle. Once you have created your vehicle, a VIN will be assigned to it automatically and you will be given a series of actions the vehicle can take. Depending on the vehicle type certain actions can be done, such as a truck being able to tow another vehicle or a motorbike being able to perform a wheelie. When you are ready to end the program, simply select exit from the list of actions.
